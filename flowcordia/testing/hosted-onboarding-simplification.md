# Hosted onboarding simplification

The hosted customer path is intentionally separate from self-host installation administration. A new customer should understand the successful path without knowing Flowcordia's internal deployment model. Completion means reaching a usable Studio, not merely creating account records.

## Customer journey

A first hosted user should complete only these product decisions:

1. Name the workspace. Flowcordia creates the first project automatically.
2. Authorize Flowcordia's platform-owned GitHub App.
3. Choose the repository. Flowcordia uses its default branch automatically.
4. Continue directly into Flowcordia Studio.

Additional projects ask only for a project name before using the same project-scoped GitHub setup.

## Hidden operator concerns

Hosted customers must not configure or inspect:

- the installation owner;
- PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, object storage, or internal service readiness;
- email transport credentials or live transport tests;
- the GitHub App ID, slug, private key, or webhook secret;
- self-host recovery and release evidence.

Those remain self-host or platform-operator responsibilities. A hosted GitHub App outage is presented as a platform problem rather than asking the customer to create an App.

## Product rule

Survey data such as company size, company URL, technologies, and goals cannot block activation. Collect it later only when it clearly benefits the user.

After Studio opens, project settings may expose advanced repository choices such as a non-default production branch; first-run onboarding must not require them.

This change must stay confined to hosted onboarding routes, their route helpers, focused tests, and this contract; generated catalogs and unrelated product areas are outside its scope.
