# Production closure acceptance evidence

## Decision

Protected production and rollback-production acceptance must prove the same immutable workflow closure that gates Studio execution. A successful root run is not sufficient launch evidence when a reviewed child workflow could be missing from the authoritative worker.

## Operator-supplied identity

The protected workflow requires:

- the exact application commit;
- proposal head and merge commit;
- authoritative deployment version;
- immutable closure digest; and
- expected closure workflow count between 1 and 100.

The browser harness compares those values only with bounded server-owned Studio attributes. It cannot choose the environment, worker, task rows, repository installation, credentials, or runtime metadata.

Production mode binds the original promoted closure. Rollback-production mode binds the newly governed rollback proposal's own closure rather than inheriting or assuming the earlier production closure.

## Browser proof

Before execution and again after verified completion, the harness requires:

- production state `READY`;
- closure state `READY`;
- exact closure digest equality;
- expected task count equal to the operator-supplied count; and
- installed task count equal to the expected count.

The digest and counts must remain unchanged across the destructive browser command. Any movement requires a new protected acceptance run rather than reusing partial evidence.

Only then may the harness execute the existing authenticated Studio production command and preserve sanitized schema `0.2` evidence.

## Launch dossier binding

The immutable launch-dossier validator accepts production and rollback-production artifacts only when their schema `0.2` closure proof is complete and internally consistent. The source artifact digest already binds the exact evidence bytes into the dossier; no worker IDs, task IDs, payloads, outputs, credentials, or raw provider data are copied into the manifest.

The dossier validates the closure proof but does not restate internal task membership. Reviewers can verify exact evidence lineage without expanding the sensitive-data surface. Replacing either production artifact with a legacy or root-only artifact changes its evidence digest and fails validation before dossier creation.

Repository CI proves the schema, workflow source, browser assertions, validator behavior, and sensitive-data boundary. Only a configured protected run can produce the connected evidence required for launch review.

## Exclusions

This contract does not run the protected environment automatically, activate schedules or webhooks, create a second runtime path, or replace human review of the connected evidence artifact.
