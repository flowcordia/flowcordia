# Governed GitHub proposals

## Purpose

`@flowcordia/github-proposals` turns a validated visual workflow change into a native GitHub review without requiring a non-developer to understand branches, checks, review freshness, or merge races.

  participant Studio
  participant API as Proposal API + durable saga
  participant Store as Workflow store
  participant GH as GitHub
  participant Index as Webhook projection

  Studio->>API: Create proposal(base commit/blob, desired workflow)
  API->>GH: Create deterministic branch at exact base
  API->>Store: Save canonical workflow with expected blob
  API->>GH: Open draft pull request
  GH-->>Index: Branch / pull_request webhooks
  Studio->>API: Submit exact head
  API->>GH: Mark ready for review
  GH-->>Index: Reviews and checks
  Studio->>API: Promote exact head
  API->>GH: Fetch PR + all reviews/checks/statuses
  API->>API: Evaluate current-head policy
  API->>GH: Merge with expected head SHA
  GH-->>Index: Merge webhook
```

## Authority split

| Concern | Authority | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow content/history | Git commit and blob | Human review, rollback, ownership, and immutable identity. |
| Proposal identity and operation state | Durable Flowcordia proposal aggregate | Tenant binding, saga recovery, audit, and UI lifecycle. |
| Branch, PR, reviews, checks, merge | GitHub | Native repository policy and organization governance. |
| Product blocker explanation | Pure Flowcordia policy evaluation over a fresh snapshot | Consistent UI and fail-closed API behavior. |
| Search/live proposal summaries | Webhook-fed projection | Low latency without polling every repository. |
| Runtime release | Reviewed source commit plus compiled deployment version | Connect governed intent to executable identity. |

The PR body marker aids recovery but grants no authority. The durable aggregate binds it to the authorized tenant/project/installation/repository and exact PR number.

## Lifecycle invariants

- Proposal IDs are caller-generated opaque identifiers and map to deterministic branches.
- A durable SHA-256 of canonical desired workflow content prevents the same proposal ID from being retried with different intent.
- Creation starts only if the base branch still equals the caller's base commit.
- Workflow writes retain expected-blob concurrency from the storage layer.
- A closed PR makes the proposal ID terminal; a new attempt uses a new ID.
- Submission and promotion require the exact expected head.
- Current-head approvals, pull-request-author and proposal-creator self-approval exclusion, required reviewers, and required checks are policy defaults or explicit inputs.
- Every collection used for policy is paginated.
- GitHub repository rules are always final; the application has no bypass path.
- Unknown mutation outcomes enter reconciliation, never blind retry.

## Enterprise integration boundary

`@flowcordia/control-plane` and the webapp proposal feature now own authorization, durable aggregate/outbox persistence, webhook ingestion, and the internal API projection. They pass authorized scope into this package and persist returned receipts. This package intentionally owns no database client, session, queue, or browser state, keeping the GitHub lifecycle portable and testable. Studio presentation, reconciliation scheduling, and outbox broker publication remain later adapters.
