# Production self-host application plane

This runbook deploys the supported initial Flowcordia application plane from one immutable release image. It owns one release-confirmed migration job, one HTTP web replica, one isolated proposal/index operations replica, and one optional no-overwrite diagnostics service.

It does **not** bundle PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Electric, S3-compatible object storage, email delivery, TLS ingress, or the inherited Trigger.dev execution-plane services. Those dependencies must already exist and pass the release preflight and connected acceptance gates.

## Supported initial topology

- one `linux/amd64` image referenced by `repository@sha256:digest`;
- one `migrate` one-shot service;
- exactly one `web` replica bound to host loopback;
- exactly one HTTP-disabled `operations` replica;
- one optional `doctor` one-shot service enabled through the `diagnostics` profile;
- one canonical release manifest mounted read-only into every role;
- protected host directories for migration-completion and diagnostics evidence;
- read-only application root filesystems with bounded `/tmp` tmpfs;
- all Linux capabilities dropped and `no-new-privileges` enabled.

This is a single-host, non-HA application plane. Do not advertise horizontal availability, zero-downtime schema upgrades, PITR, or cross-region recovery from this topology.

## 1. Obtain and verify the release

Use the protected image-publication workflow. Download its release manifest, bounded publication evidence, and signed attestation bundle. Independently verify the attestation as described in [`self-host-image-publication.md`](self-host-image-publication.md).

Never deploy the semantic-version or commit tag. Copy the immutable digest reference and manifest digests into the deployment configuration.

## 2. Prepare host files

Choose dedicated host directories outside the repository:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0750 -o 1000 -g 1000 /opt/flowcordia
sudo install -d -m 0700 -o 1000 -g 1000 /var/lib/flowcordia/migrations
sudo install -d -m 0700 -o 1000 -g 1000 /var/lib/flowcordia/diagnostics
sudo install -m 0640 -o 1000 -g 1000 \
  docker/flowcordia-self-host.env.example \
  /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env
sudo install -m 0600 -o 1000 -g 1000 \
  docker/flowcordia-self-host.secrets.example \
  /opt/flowcordia/deployment.secrets
sudo install -m 0440 -o 1000 -g 1000 \
  /protected/download/flowcordia-release-manifest.json \
  /opt/flowcordia/release-manifest.json
```

Replace every placeholder. The configuration file contains deployable identities and non-secret settings. The secrets file contains database URLs, encryption/session values, independent provider/coordinator/managed-worker authentication secrets, GitHub App material, object-store credentials, deployment-registry credentials when required, email credentials, and the proposal-event signing secret. A key must appear in only one file. The proposal event URL must name an external durable consumer; it must not point at a nonexistent Flowcordia web route.

The container image runs as UID/GID `1000`; the manifest must be readable and the migration/diagnostics evidence directories writable by that identity.

## 3. Validate before mutation

Run the deterministic validator from the exact repository revision corresponding to the selected release tooling:

```bash
pnpm flowcordia:self-host:validate \
  --config /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  --secrets /opt/flowcordia/deployment.secrets \
  --manifest /opt/flowcordia/release-manifest.json

docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  --profile diagnostics \
  config --quiet
```

The gate blocks mismatched image/application/manifest identity, unsafe or divergent origins, malformed GitHub App configuration, public/default/shared control-plane secrets, invalid or contradictory dependency identities, incomplete object storage or email, missing deployment-registry configuration, unsupported replica counts, overlapping config/secrets, unsafe file permissions, and application replicas that could race migrations. It requires exact agreement between `DATABASE_HOST` and the PostgreSQL URLs, one shared HTTPS application/login origin, and the same object-store provider resolution used by runtime uploads.

Then run the existing release-candidate, provider, alert, backup/restore, and controlled-upgrade gates for the exact release.

## 4. Pull without starting

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  pull
```

Confirm the pulled repository digest equals `FLOWCORDIA_IMAGE_REFERENCE` and `FLOWCORDIA_IMAGE_DIGEST` from the canonical manifest.

## 5. Apply migrations once

Stop the current application replicas before a migration-bearing upgrade. Then run only the release-confirmed one-shot service:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from migrate migrate
```

The job:

1. verifies the mounted manifest, external manifest digest, application commit, image digest, and Node runtime;
2. requires `FLOWCORDIA_MIGRATION_CONFIRM` to equal the manifest release ID;
3. applies and verifies Prisma migrations;
4. applies and verifies dashboard-agent Drizzle migrations;
5. validates and applies ClickHouse migrations;
6. atomically writes owner-only completion evidence under the protected migration state directory.

Do not start web or operations replicas after a failed migration. Preserve logs and the migration evidence file with the release record.

## 6. Start operations, then web

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  up -d --wait operations

docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  up -d --wait web
```

The operations container is healthy only while its event loop refreshes a bounded local readiness pulse tied to the exact application revision. The web container is healthy only when the existing `/healthcheck` route confirms release identity, plugins, and PostgreSQL readiness.

All long-running replicas set every migration skip flag to `1`. Published Flowcordia replicas fail boot if any migration path is enabled.

## 7. Configure ingress

The Compose file publishes web only on `127.0.0.1` by default. Terminate HTTPS in a separately managed reverse proxy or load balancer and forward to the loopback port. Preserve the exact public `APP_ORIGIN` and `LOGIN_ORIGIN`; do not expose the container directly on all interfaces.

The public `/healthcheck` path must be reachable directly over HTTPS without redirect before release diagnostics can be READY.

## 8. Run published-image diagnostics

After operations, web, and HTTPS ingress are healthy, run the optional diagnostics profile:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file /opt/flowcordia/deployment.env \
  -f docker/flowcordia-self-host.yml \
  --profile diagnostics \
  up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from doctor doctor
```

The doctor service uses the same immutable image and manifest, waits for both application roles, performs bounded read-only release/dependency/provider-configuration/health checks, and writes one owner-only no-overwrite artifact:

```text
/var/lib/flowcordia/diagnostics/<release-id>.json
```

The release must stop on `BLOCKED` or `UNAVAILABLE`. A second run for the same release intentionally fails rather than replacing the preserved artifact. Follow [`self-host-diagnostics.md`](self-host-diagnostics.md) for the evidence boundary and safe support handoff.

## 9. Prove the published lifecycle

Before treating the topology as a supported release path, run the protected two-publication lifecycle workflow described in [`self-host-lifecycle-acceptance.md`](self-host-lifecycle-acceptance.md). Preserve its schema `0.1` evidence with the release dossier.

Repository topology CI and a manually healthy installation do not replace the protected clean-install, restart, recovery, upgrade, rollback-boundary, and teardown proof.

## 10. Verify the connected journey

After diagnostics, dependencies, and providers are READY:

1. run the protected browser-to-preview-to-production acceptance journey;
2. run signed production webhook acceptance, including replay, revocation, replacement, and predecessor isolation;
3. verify proposal/index operations heartbeat and local container health;
4. exercise the exact rollback path;
5. assemble and review the schema `0.4` launch dossier.

Repository CI, healthy containers, or READY diagnostics alone are not production acceptance.

## Controlled upgrade

For every target release:

1. preserve and rehearse a backup for the exact current release;
2. verify the target image attestation, manifest, and publication evidence;
3. run controlled-upgrade and topology validation with exact current/target revisions;
4. update all host files atomically, including `FLOWCORDIA_MIGRATION_CONFIRM`;
5. create a fresh protected diagnostics directory for the target release evidence;
6. pull the new digest;
7. stop web and operations for migration-bearing releases;
8. run the one-shot migration job;
9. start and wait for operations first, then web;
10. run published-image diagnostics;
11. execute connected acceptance and preserve evidence.

Never run old and new application revisions against an unproven shared schema.

## Rollback

### Application-only release

When the controlled-upgrade evidence proves no database changes:

1. restore the previous manifest/config identities;
2. select a fresh protected diagnostics directory;
3. pull the previous immutable digest;
4. stop web and operations;
5. run the previous release migration job as an idempotent status/no-op check;
6. start operations, then web;
7. run previous-release diagnostics;
8. execute rollback acceptance and preserve evidence.

### Migration-bearing release

Do not point the previous application at a forward-only schema unless backward compatibility was explicitly proved. Stop the application plane, restore the rehearsed database backup into the supported recovery target, select the previous release manifest and image, restart operations and web, run previous-release diagnostics, then run rollback acceptance.

## Stop-ship

Do not deploy when:

- the image is referenced by a tag;
- attestation or publication evidence cannot be verified;
- config, secrets, manifest, migration-state, or diagnostics-state paths are inside the repository or have unsafe ownership/modes;
- the topology validator is not READY;
- the migration job is not release-confirmed or does not complete every owned datastore;
- any application replica can run migrations;
- the web or operations health contract is unavailable;
- the public origin is not protected by HTTPS ingress or redirects the health path;
- published-image diagnostics is not READY, belongs to another release, exposes unbounded values, or overwrote prior evidence;
- external dependency, provider, recovery, upgrade, published lifecycle, connected acceptance, webhook, rollback, or dossier evidence is missing.
