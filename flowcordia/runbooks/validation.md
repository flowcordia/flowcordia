# Validation runbook

## Documentation and schema

1. Validate Markdown links and Mermaid syntax during review.
2. Validate every JSON document against its declared schema.
3. Validate `specs/workflow.schema.json` as JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.
4. Confirm the connection registry reflects every changed component.
5. Validate `.flowcordia/functions.json` against `packages/flowcordia-workflow/schema/functions-0.1.json` when a repository publishes custom functions.

## Web application foundation

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run typecheck --filter webapp
pnpm run test --filter webapp -- --run
pnpm run lint --filter webapp
```

## Setup-status manual test

1. Start the existing core Docker services.
2. Start the webapp from the feature branch.
3. Sign in and open the hidden organization setup URL directly.
4. Confirm only presence/missing status appears; no secret value may be present in HTML or loader data.
5. Confirm the general email test is disabled or returns a safe error when configuration is incomplete.
6. With a test transport, send one message and confirm it targets only the signed-in user.
7. Confirm unexpected failures are logged server-side and return a generic user-facing message.

## Repository readiness manual test

1. Follow `repository-readiness-rollout.md` in a dedicated connected repository.
2. Confirm direct access requires Studio feature access and dashboard GitHub read permission.
3. Confirm the browser sends only the exact bounded `{ "operation": "check" }` command.
4. Prove the exact GitHub App installation plus contents-write, pull-request-write, and checks-read permissions.
5. Prove the production branch resolves to one immutable commit and the workflow catalog, durable index, `trigger.config.ts`, generated-task discovery, and preview setting all belong to that exact connected scope.
6. Inspect the response and HTML for credentials, installation/database IDs, provider request IDs, raw errors, workflow content, configuration source, payloads, outputs, and runtime metadata. None may appear.
7. Prove permission/configuration gaps render `BLOCKED` and provider uncertainty renders `UNAVAILABLE`; neither may appear ready.
8. Continue with the authenticated preview-deployment acceptance run. Repository readiness is prerequisite evidence, not execution proof.

## Proposal workspace manual test

1. Follow `proposal-workspace-rollout.md` with the global flag off and one organization override enabled.
2. Confirm direct routes recheck feature access and GitHub read permission, and command routes recheck GitHub write permission.
3. Inspect loader and successful command payloads for the documented browser DTO; no internal scope, credential, actor, correlation, version, workflow content, or raw provider error may appear.
4. Confirm filters reset pagination, each page is at most 50 records, and the selected proposal remains within the loaded page.
5. Prove `DRAFT -> submit`, `READY -> promote`, and no action for missing head, reconciliation, failure, or terminal states.
6. Prove a stale expected head and unsatisfied GitHub policy fail without an automatic mutation retry.
7. Confirm disabling the Studio flag removes navigation and direct access without changing the internal proposal API, worker, deployment, or runtime behavior.

## Proposal governance manual test

1. Follow `proposal-governance-rollout.md` in a dedicated connected repository.
2. Select a non-first proposal and prove the displayed/evaluated head belongs to that proposal.
3. Save an initial policy, strengthen it, then prove approval/check/reviewer removal and allowlist expansion return `403` without a version change.
4. Prove later comments do not replace decisive approvals and dismissed approvals do not count.
5. Prove pending checks/validation, known blockers, and unavailable evidence render distinct states and all prevent premature promotion.
6. Prove promotion selects and audits one unchanged policy version/digest, then the proposal service rereads fresh GitHub evidence and sends the exact expected head to merge.
7. Retry the same bounded request identity and verify audit idempotency; change the policy or payload and verify fail-closed conflict.

## Pull-request acceptance

- Required checks pass on the exact head SHA.
- Required checks start on GitHub-hosted runners when no Flowcordia runner variables are configured.
- Optional enterprise runner variables resolve to labels that are online and authorized for the repository.
- Zizmor completes with console results when `ENABLE_WORKFLOW_SECURITY_SCAN` is unset, ignores informational-only advice, and blocks low-or-higher findings.
- When `ENABLE_WORKFLOW_SECURITY_SCAN=true`, GitHub Advanced Security is enabled and accepts the SARIF upload.
- Claude jobs skip unless the GitHub App is installed and `ENABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=true`; manual drift audits also require the installed app.
- No run-engine, supervisor, queue, database schema, Docker service name, or CLI behavior changed.
- The PR explains validation limitations when a check could not be executed.
