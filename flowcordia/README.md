# FlowCordia engineering index

FlowCordia is a Git-native workflow platform built on the Trigger.dev execution foundation. It adds a visual Studio, portable typed workflow contracts, governed GitHub collaboration, exact-head runtime evidence, signed production ingress, and an enterprise control plane without duplicating the durable run engine.

**Current maturity:** internal alpha. Repository contracts and tests are strong; a preserved connected reference release acceptance record remains a release gate.

## Source-of-truth rules

- Trigger.dev remains the execution foundation until a decision record explicitly replaces a subsystem.
- Git is the durable history for workflow definitions, generated artifacts, reviews, releases, and rollbacks.
- The FlowCordia workflow model is the contract shared by Studio, code tooling, GitHub adapters, and runtime generation.
- A subflow proposal is reviewable only when one no-overwrite manifest locks every reachable workflow and generated artifact at the final pull-request head.
- Secrets never enter workflow files, generated source, audit payloads, browser projections, or support diagnostics.
- Public webhook execution resolves one immutable active binding; it never discovers a mutable latest deployment at request time.
- Self-host diagnostics run from the exact published image and preserve only fixed states, messages, release identities, timestamps, and digests.
- Self-host lifecycle evidence binds distinct official publication runs, immutable migration evidence, recovery rehearsal, upgrade kind, safe rollback behavior, teardown, and official workflow identity without preserving config, credentials, URLs, archives, or raw logs.
- Canvas repository tests, manual assistive-technology acceptance, and measured large-graph browser evidence remain separate requirements; none replaces the others.
- Every new subsystem documents what it connects to, why the connection exists, who owns it, and how it fails.
- Repository CI, diagnostics, and connected acceptance are separate required evidence; none replaces the others.

## Folder map

- `product/` — product promise, maturity, capability coverage, and delivery order.
- `architecture/` — system boundaries and contracts between planes.
- `connections/` — the live registry of component-to-component connections.
- `decisions/` — architecture decisions and rejected alternatives.
- `security/` — trust, identity, authorization, secret, and browser-data boundaries.
- `testing/` — contract, failure, integration, and acceptance matrices.
- `runbooks/` — validation, rollout, release, recovery, rollback, and support procedures.
- `specs/` — machine-readable contracts beginning with workflow schema `0.1`.
- `research/` — evidence gathered from the inherited Trigger.dev repository.

## Completion rule

A FlowCordia feature is not complete until:

1. its configuration and browser interaction are explicit;
2. input, output, identity, authorization, and secret boundaries are validated;
3. serialization and compilation are deterministic;
4. execution and observability use the intended owning platform services;
5. failure, retry, idempotency, timeout, and ambiguous outcomes are known;
6. repository, diagnostics, and connected-environment evidence are distinguished honestly;
7. rollout and rollback are documented and testable;
8. the connection registry, machine-readable catalog, public README, compatibility policy, and capability matrix match delivered behavior;
9. the change is tied to one reviewed branch, commit, and pull request;
10. no Trigger.dev core behavior changed without an explicit decision record.
